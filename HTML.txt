1)What is vs code editor?

Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is a code editor made by Microsoft. It works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and web browsers.
Its features include:
Debugging
Syntax highlighting
Smart code completion
Code refactoring
Built-in version control with Git


2)What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages.


3)Features of HTML?

It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.
Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their website)
HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.
It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages


4)Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language?

Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, 
while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.


5)A beautiful analogy to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

In building a webpage, think of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as different parts of a car.
HTML is like the car's skeleton, forming the basic structure and frame. CSS adds the paint and finishing touches, making the car look appealing with color, style, and design.
JavaScript is similar to the engine and mechanical parts, infusing the car with functionality, movement, and interactive features. Similarly, when developing a website, HTML lays out the structure,
CSS enhances its visual appeal, and JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic content.



6)History of HTML:
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee established the World Wide Web (www), and in 1991, he created the first version of HTML.
From 1995 to 1997, further work was done to develop and refine different versions of HTML.
In 1999, a committee was organized that standardized HTML 4.0, a version still used by many today.
The latest and most stable version of HTML is 5, also known as HTML5.

7)How does a basic website work?
Web Browser(client) requests websites like www.linkedin.com from the web server.
Web server in return sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to it.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are parsed by a web browser which is responsible for showing you a beautiful website.


8)HTML Page Structure
An HTML document is structured using a set of nested tags. Each tag is enclosed within <…> angle brackets and acts as a container for content or other HTML tags.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
   <!-- content -->
</body>
</html>

** DOCTYPE Declaration
<!DOCTYPE html>
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration informs the web browser about the HTML version being used. 

** HTML Root Element
<html>
The <html> tag is the root element that encapsulates all the content on the page.

** </html>
The </html> tag marks the end of the <html> section.

** Head Section
<head>
The <head> tag contains metadata and links to external resources like CSS and JavaScript files.

** </head>
The </head> tag marks the end of the <head> section.

** Title Tag
<title>Document</title>
The <title> tag sets the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

** Body Tag
<body>
The <body> tag contains the visible content of the web page. This is where text, images, and other elements go.

** </body>
The </body> tag marks the end of the visible content of the web page.

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is one of the three Core Web Vitals metrics, and it represents how quickly the main content of a web page is loaded.
