2)What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages.


3)Features of HTML?

It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.
Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their website)
HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.
It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages


4)Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language?

Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, 
while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.


5)A beautiful analogy to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

In building a webpage, think of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as different parts of a car.
HTML is like the car's skeleton, forming the basic structure and frame. CSS adds the paint and finishing touches, making the car look appealing with color, style, and design.
JavaScript is similar to the engine and mechanical parts, infusing the car with functionality, movement, and interactive features. Similarly, when developing a website, HTML lays out the structure,
CSS enhances its visual appeal, and JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic content.



6)History of HTML:
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee established the World Wide Web (www), and in 1991, he created the first version of HTML.
From 1995 to 1997, further work was done to develop and refine different versions of HTML.
In 1999, a committee was organized that standardized HTML 4.0, a version still used by many today.
The latest and most stable version of HTML is 5, also known as HTML5.

7)How does a basic website work?
Web Browser(client) requests websites like www.linkedin.com from the web server.
Web server in return sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to it.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are parsed by a web browser which is responsible for showing you a beautiful website.
