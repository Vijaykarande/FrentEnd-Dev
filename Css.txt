1)What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the visual presentation of a web page written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

HTML creates the structure of the page, while CSS adds styling to that structure.


2)Why the word "cascade"?
The term "cascade" refers to the priority scheme determining which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules target an element.


3)A Bit of History:-
CSS was created by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to enhance the visual aspects of websites.

4)Syntax of CSS

The general syntax for writing CSS.


For example:

h2{
    color: blue;
}

In the example:

h2: h2 is the selector.
color: It's the property.
blue: The property value.



5)Ways to add CSS
There are three different ways to add CSS to an HTML page, which are:

* Inline CSS
Inline CSS is used to add custom properties to specific elements.
	<h1 style="color: purple;">I'm harry</h1>


* Internal CSS
Internal CSS is used to apply custom style to the multiple elements on the same page.

<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Vijay Karande</h1>
    <p>I'm Vijay Karande</p>
    <p>I'm a Developer</p>
</body>

</html>


* External CSS

External CSS works similarly to internal CSS but with a twist. Instead of adding the styles within the HTML file, we create a separate file with .css extension.


6)What are CSS Selectors?
CSS selectors allow us to choose specific elements and apply styles to them. 

 * Universal Selector :
		Universal selector represented by "*" targets all the HTML elements on the page.
		
* Element Selector :
		The element selector selects the target element based on the specific type.

* Id Selector
		The ID selector targets the elements based on the specific ID.
* Class Selector
		The Class selector targets the elements based on the specific Class.

* Group Selector
The group selector is used to minimise the code. Commas "," are used to separate each selector in a grouping.

	div, p, a {
    property : value;
}

:root {

  --main-font-size: 16px;
}
Use a Variable:

You use the var() function to access the value of a CSS variable.

  font-size: var(--main-font-size);
}

A media query in CSS is used to apply styles to a web page based on the characteristics of the device it is being viewed on,
 such as screen size, resolution, orientation, etc.
